            Because investments in fossil fuels can return
            <strong>generational wealth</strong>. But have you noticed? Oil has
            its ups and downs. Water? We always need it. And there’s less and
            less of it all the time. It’s the stable new asset class that’s now
            in demand. And it’s incredibly beneficial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Water is a trillion dollar global industry always expanding ─ and
            now… you can invest directly in water production. It’s literally:
            Water Like An Oil Well™. Wait—doesn’t the government handle all our
            water treatment? How do I invest in commercial water projects?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, no, the government <strong>isn’t</strong> doing a great job of
            handling things. And we’ll tell you how you
            <strong>can</strong> benefit from that. First, let’s take a look at
            the problem… and the <strong>investment megatrend</strong> that is
            coming out of it.

            Central Water Treatment Is Broken.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Droughts, toxic drinking water, broken sewer mains are the news
            every week, it seems. The list is long. Why is this happening?
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s simple: our Federal government has been reducing funding to
            cities and counties for decades. What they do give today is in the
            form of loans, no longer grants.
          </p>
          <p>Sorry, cities! And the whole system is starting to break down.</p>

          <p>
            So today, our 100,000+ water systems can’t handle the demand. And
            it’s getting worse.
          </p>
          <p>What about the infrastructure bill?</p>
          <p>
            In its Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a
            “once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure and
            competitiveness”, Washington has approved $55 billion for water.
            Woop-woop!
          </p>
          <p>Will that do the job?</p>

          <p>So… what happens now? Who pays for all this?</p>
          <p>
            If you mean cities and counties, they just can’t. They are out of
            money, and Washington isn’t helping anytime soon.
          </p>
          <div class="yellow-card">
            <h3>The solution?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, you know what comes next. Yep, they’re now making private
              businesses clean their own water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why not? After all, agriculture and industry, together, are
              responsible for 87% of all water usage. Make them clean up their
              own messes! Right?
            </p>
            <p>
              And that’s exactly what cities and counties are doing all over
              America, right now.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “Don’t send us your dirty water. Send us only treated water!”

          <p>
            And businesses? They have no choice but to comply. And maybe they
            should. But who’s paying for this? Let’s say you’re a brewery, and
            you now need to treat your own water. Do you have a cool million
            dollars sitting around? Few do. They’d rather invest in, say, making
            more beer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is, thousands of businesses need help to manage their
            water. A problem they never had before. And that they never budgeted
            for! (And the grants don’t really exist, either.)

          </p>
          <p>
            A future where industry, business and agriculture clean their own
            water─and get it with no capital expense, no maintenance costs.
          </p>
          <p>Just 100% PROBLEM SOLVED.</p>
          <p>
            It’s called Water On Demand™, and it is the answer to the prayers of
            potentially thousands of businesses all over North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            But before I describe it, let’s look back at how this came about.
          </p>
          <h2>How did we get here</h2>
          <p>
            Back in 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, we here at the public
            company OriginClear, were looking at tens of millions of dollars in
            slow-moving water projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we could find the bug, then a HUGE amount of business could be
            unleashed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, we found out what could unleash it. Our realization? “It’s the
            money, stupid!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years, the support of our long-time investors, and many
            thousands of hours of hard work later, we have a commercial pilot
            program that (we predict) will grow to become the water industry’s
            newest and greatest program… Water On Demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting last September, money started flowing into the program. And
            we are in negotiations to set up the first pilot contracts.
            Literally, they want clean water ─ they get clean water. On Demand.

          <p>
            As a Founding Investor in this brand-new asset class, you can earn
            profits secured by the water assets (that we plan to fully index to
            that HUGE inflation in water rates), PLUS you get ultra-generous
            equity leverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            You say inflation? Water rates are among the worst. We can help
            businesses save money and still get great, inflation-protected
            returns!

            As a Founder, you get a HUGE potential equity upside… Potentially

          <h2>So, how does this work?</h2>
          <h3>Step One: The Right Technology</h3>
          <p>
            If you’re making beer, you want to make beer… not clean the water!
            So, those machines have to be simple and tough.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why our Water Systems In A Box™ are so popular. Our Modular
            Water Systems™ are the right technology for the new, fully-financed
            water systems for business.
          </p>
          <figure class="section-secondary__figure">

              src="./assets/water-on-demand.png?as=webp"
              alt="Federal spending on water graph"
              class="section-secondary__image"
            />
          </figure>
          <h3>Step Two: Total Outsourcing</h3>
          <p>We actually filed a patent on how we do some of this</p>
          <p>
            This is how we do it. We sign up the customer for a multi-year
            managed services contract. All they have to do is pay by the gallon,
            we take care of the rest. No capital expense, they just pay one
            monthly bill. We take care of the maintenance, everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Pay by the month” is profitable. Have you noticed that you’re
            paying more by the month for Microsoft Office? But, have you noticed
            that it’s a better product?
          </p>
          <p>
            Managed services are sweeping the world of business, and for good
            reason: everybody wins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now it’s water’s turn. Our models show it’s both profitable, and
            contractually assured revenue. Once a business commits to Water On
            Demand, it can’t stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s a snapshot from our 25-year model. With just a $20 million
            investment in a basket of water systems, we generate $40 million for
            the investors alone!

            Did you know that you can invest directly in oil production and
            pipelines? It’s called a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). Invented
            in 1981 by Apache Corporation, it’s a great way to build
            generational wealth from oil exploration and production.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve based Water On Demand™ on those MLPs – with a better incentive
            structure. How? Imagine an investment program that lets you share in
            profits from Water On Demand projects, while also getting a
            long-term stock position
            <strong>(and major additional leverage)</strong> in the parent
            company.
          </p>
          <p>Here are three aspects our investors are excited about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your profit share is backed up by real security agreements.</li>
            <li>
              We plan to index the underlying contracts to inflation ─ to
              protect you from loss of value.
            </li>
            <li>
              This model has the potential to pay you monthly residual income
              for up to 25 years ─ and we’re working on accelerating that income
